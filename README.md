## Features {#features}

All features can be accessed via the `Command Palette` (Ctrl + Shift + P). Make sure to check the [Settings](#settings) to use all commands properly.

> When running commands which generate output a `aldesco-output` Folder will be created at the top level of the currently opened Project Directory.

**1. Open Visualizer**: Opens a new or shows the current Visualizer Webview without a vis file.

**2. Open Most Recent**: Opens the most recently created or changed vis file inside a Visualizer Webview from the `visualizer-logs` folder.

**3. Duplicate Visualizer**: Duplicates the last used Visualizer Webview and syncs actions from the other Visualizer and vice versa. This command will only appear once a Visualizer Webview has been created.

**4. Open File in Visualizer**: A vis file can be either right-clicked and opened inside the Visualizer Webview or with a vis file opened and focused in the editor, the command can be run in the Command Palette.

**5. Visualize Spoon AST**: Open a file to be visualized and either run the command in the `Command Palette` to visualize the entire file or right-click a line of a method or element to visualize the Spoon AST of the selected element.

**6. Set a Chain and Match Folder**: A Chain can be set by either right-clicking a CLASS File in the VS Code Explorer or by running the command in the `Command Palette` and choosing a CLASS File in the File Explorer. The Chain can also be set by directly by providing the absolute path of a Chain inside the aldesco-extension [Settings](#extension-settings). To view the current Chain, run the **Show current Chain** command in the `Command Palette`. Lastly, right-click or select a folder with the **Match Folder with Chain** command and match the folder with the currently selected Chain.
